Today many big organizations are sitting on large chunks of data, not knowing what to do with it.
They invite consultants & business analysts to have a look at data and come up with insights that could help the organization run their business better. 
There is no clear set of instructions in such open-ended problems and it is expected of the consultant to do a lot of exploration first and formulate the problems themselves. This DVT project falls into the bucket of such open-ended problems and a specific problem statement has not been given intentionally. 
It is expected of students to explore the data and come up with good insights.
